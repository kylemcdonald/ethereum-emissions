	abstract = {Carbon intensity of power generation is an important indicator to show the direct competitiveness of electricity against the combustion of fossil fuels. In this study, we estimate the carbon intensities of power generation in China’s provinces. Most provinces are likely to have a carbon intensity per unit of power generation between 500 and 700 g CO2/kWh in 2020, which justifies the progress of electrification from the power generation perspective. With the growing share of low carbon power generation, most provinces show trends of decline in carbon intensity between 2015 and 2020. However, some provinces are expected to see increase in carbon intensity due to increasing share of coal power generation in their power mixes. Coal is still a major growth contributor in most provinces, despite significant growths of low carbon energy sources. Furthermore, renewable energy sources can help reduce the carbon intensity of power generation, but a better coordination among provinces is required, alongside with strong government support and direction.},

	shorttitle = {New kids on the block},
	url = {https://arxiv.org/abs/1606.06530v1},
	abstract = {Half a decade after Bitcoin became the first widely used cryptocurrency, blockchains are receiving considerable interest from industry and the research community. Modern blockchains feature services such as name registration and smart contracts. Some employ new forms of consensus, such as proof-of-stake instead of proof-of-work. However, these blockchains are so far relatively poorly investigated, despite the fact that they move considerable assets. In this paper, we explore three representative, modern blockchains---Ethereum, Namecoin, and Peercoin. Our focus is on the features that set them apart from the pure currency use case of Bitcoin. We investigate the blockchains' activity in terms of transactions and usage patterns, identifying some curiosities in the process. For Ethereum, we are mostly interested in the smart contract functionality it offers. We also carry out a brief analysis of issues that are introduced by negligent design of smart contracts. In the case of Namecoin, our focus is how the name registration is used and has developed over time. For Peercoin, we are interested in the use of proof-of-stake, as this consensus algorithm is poorly understood yet used to move considerable value. Finally, we relate the above to the fundamental characteristics of the underlying peer-to-peer networks. We present a crawler for Ethereum and give statistics on the network size. For Peercoin and Namecoin, we identify the relatively small size of the networks and the weak bootstrapping process.},

	abstract = {Ethereum, the second-largest cryptocurrency valued at a peak of \$138 billion in 2018, is a decentralized, Turing-complete computing platform. Although the stability and security of Ethereum---and blockchain systems in general---have been widely-studied, most analysis has focused on application level features of these systems such as cryptographic mining challenges, smart contract semantics, or block mining operators. Little attention has been paid to the underlying peer-to-peer (P2P) networks that are responsible for information propagation and that enable blockchain consensus. In this work, we develop NodeFinder to measure this previously opaque network at scale and illuminate the properties of its nodes. We analyze the Ethereum network from two vantage points: a three-month long view of nodes on the P2P network, and a single day snapshot of the Ethereum Mainnet peers. We uncover a noisy DEVp2p ecosystem in which fewer than half of all nodes contribute to the Ethereum Mainnet. Through a comparison with other previously studied P2P networks including BitTorrent, Gnutella, and Bitcoin, we find that Ethereum differs in both network size and geographical distribution.},

We describe our experience on a detailed, one-month study of the Ethereum network from several geographically dispersed observation points. We leverage multiple geographic vantage points to assess the key pillars of Ethereum, namely geographical dispersion, network efficiency, blockchain efficiency and security, and the impact of mining pools. Among other new findings, we identify previously undocumented forms of selfish behavior and show that the prevalence of powerful mining pools exacerbates the geographical impact on block propagation delays. Furthermore, we provide a set of open measurement and processing tools, as well as the data set of the collected measurements, in order to promote further research on understanding permissionless blockchains.},

	abstract = {The project “Development of the electricity carbon emission factors for Russia” was awarded by The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) to Lahmeyer International with Perspectives as subcontractor.
It is a Baseline Study with the overall goal to calculate reliable carbon emission factors for the period from 2010 to 2020. These electricity carbon emission factors for the Russian Integrated Power Systems (IPS) can be used to derive the baseline scenario of future Joint Implementation (JI) project activities under the Kyoto Protocol. The availability of these factors reduces transaction costs as in order to qualify under JI, a project needs to show that its emissions are below such scenario.
By utilising JI, amongst others, a substitution of emission intensive fossil-fuelled power
generation towards more efficient power supply is facilitated. Furthermore, the issued carbon certificates, earned from to the emission reductions achieved, serve as an additional project cofinancing source.
This paper describes the study outcome and elaborates on co-financing possibilities for project owners by utilising JI in order to promote climate-friendly projects in Russia.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}{\textless}strong class="journal-contentHeaderColor"{\textgreater}Abstract.{\textless}/strong{\textgreater} Accurate assessment of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) emissions and their redistribution among the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere in a changing climate – the “global carbon budget” – is important to better understand the global carbon cycle, support the development of climate policies, and project future climate change. Here we describe and synthesize data sets and methodology to quantify the five major components of the global carbon budget and their uncertainties. Fossil CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} emissions ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{FOS}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) are based on energy statistics and cement production data, while emissions from land-use change ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{E}$_{\textrm{LUC}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), mainly deforestation, are based on land use and land-use change data and bookkeeping models. Atmospheric CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} concentration is measured directly and its growth rate ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{G}$_{\textrm{ATM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) is computed from the annual changes in concentration. The ocean CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{OCEAN}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) and terrestrial CO{\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}$_{\textrm{2}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater} sink ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{S}$_{\textrm{LAND}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}) are estimated with global process models constrained by observations. The resulting carbon budget imbalance ({\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}\textit{B}$_{\textrm{IM}}${\textless}/span{\textgreater}), the difference between the estimated total emissions and the estimated changes in the atmosphere, ocean, and terrestrial biosphere, is a measure of imperfect data and understanding of the contemporary carbon cycle. All uncertainties are reported as {\textless}span class="inline-formula"{\textgreater}±1\textit{σ}{\textless}/span{\textgreater}.

Our proposal includes at its heart a pay-for-performance monthly capacity auction that can help cover revenue deficiencies in the energy market. Building on international experience with capacity markets, this approach provides incentives for availability when generation is needed most and is compatible with the adoption of a single energy market for all electricity resources. Out-of-market payments to cover stranded costs of certain firms can thus be minimized. Finally, engaging consumers in both these energy and capacity markets can create high-powered incentives to shift consumption to low-cost months and hours, benefitting the entire province.},

Therefore, the optimal share of NG generation in electric power generation is a serious concern. This note attempts to estimate the optimal share by modelling the plausible relationship between NG generation and national output in the Cobb\&ndash;Douglas production function setting and then deriving the output-maximizing share of NG generation. The production function is statistically significantly estimated using annual data from 1990 to 2016, allowing for the first-order serial correlation. The optimal share is computed to be 20.3\%. Therefore, it is recommended that South Korea increases the share of NG generation slightly and makes efforts to secure a stable NG supply, given that, according to the national plan, the share will be 18.8\% in 2030.},

Our proposal includes at its heart a pay-for-performance monthly capacity auction that can help cover revenue deficiencies in the energy market. Building on international experience with capacity markets, this approach provides incentives for availability when generation is needed most and is compatible with the adoption of a single energy market for all electricity resources. Out-of-market payments to cover stranded costs of certain firms can thus be minimized. Finally, engaging consumers in both these energy and capacity markets can create high-powered incentives to shift consumption to low-cost months and hours, benefitting the entire province.},

	abstract = {How to accurately measure the interprovincial CO2 emissions is key to achieving the task of energy saving and emission reduction. Electric power is very important for economy development. At the same time, the amount of interprovincial electric power dispatching is very large in China, so it is obligatory to measure the CO2 emissions from both electricity production and consumption perspectives. We have measured China's interprovincial CO2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion during 2000–2014, in which the revised regional electric power CO2 emissions are used to adjust interprovincial CO2 emissions. The obtained results show that: no matter from which perspective one considers the situation, the overall CO2 emissions of China are almost the same amount. From different perspectives, the interprovincial CO2 emissions are different. In terms of the production perspective, CO2 emissions of Beijing, Hebei, Shandong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Guangdong are underestimated. However, Shanxi, Inner Mongolia, Hubei, Sichuan, Guizhou, and Shaanxi are overestimated. If the electric power dispatching is not considered, it is unfairly portrayed as transferring CO2 emissions from the electricity input provinces to the output ones, because the electricity input provinces enjoy clean energy, but the electricity production ones pay for the environmental pollution.},

	abstract = {There are now hundreds of cryptocurrencies in existence and the technological backbone of many of these currencies is blockchain—a digital ledger of transactions. The competitive process of adding blocks to the chain is computation-intensive and requires large energy input. Here we demonstrate a methodology for calculating the minimum power requirements of several cryptocurrency networks and the energy consumed to produce one US dollar’s (US\$) worth of digital assets. From 1 January 2016 to 30 June 2018, we estimate that mining Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and Monero consumed an average of 17, 7, 7 and 14 MJ to generate one US\$, respectively. Comparatively, conventional mining of aluminium, copper, gold, platinum and rare earth oxides consumed 122, 4, 5, 7 and 9 MJ to generate one US\$, respectively, indicating that (with the exception of aluminium) cryptomining consumed more energy than mineral mining to produce an equivalent market value. While the market prices of the coins are quite volatile, the network hashrates for three of the four cryptocurrencies have trended consistently upward, suggesting that energy requirements will continue to increase. During this period, we estimate mining for all 4 cryptocurrencies was responsible for 3–15 million tonnes of CO2 emissions.},

	abstract = {The Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5 °C (SR15) was published by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) on 8 October 2018. The report, approved in Incheon, South Korea, includes over 6,000 scientific references, and was prepared by 91 authors from 40 countries. In December 2015, the 2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference called for the report. The report was delivered at the United Nations' 48th session of the IPCC to "deliver the authoritative, scientific guide for governments" to deal with climate change.Its key finding is that meeting a 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) target is possible but would require "deep emissions reductions" and "rapid, far-reaching and unprecedented changes in all aspects of society." Furthermore, the report finds that "limiting global warming to 1.5 °C compared with 2 °C would reduce challenging impacts on ecosystems, human health and well-being" and that a 2 °C temperature increase would exacerbate extreme weather, rising sea levels and diminishing Arctic sea ice, coral bleaching, and loss of ecosystems, among other impacts. SR15 also has modelling that shows that, for global warming to be limited to 1.5 °C, "Global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) would need to fall by about 45 percent from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050." The reduction of emissions by 2030 and its associated changes and challenges, including rapid decarbonisation, was a key focus on much of the reporting which was repeated through the world.},
